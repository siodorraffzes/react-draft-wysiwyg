A no-CD patch or crack is a modified version of the game's executable file that bypasses the CD check. This allows you to run the game without inserting the CD, as long as you have the game installed on your hard drive. However, using a no-CD patch or crack may have some drawbacks, such as compatibility issues with official patches, multiplayer modes, or anti-cheat systems. Therefore, use them at your own risk and only from trusted sources.
 
For Baldur's Gate, you will need two no-CD patches: one for the base game (Shadows of Amn) and one for the expansion pack (Tales of the Sword Coast). You can find them at GameCopyWorld[^2^], under the Game Fixes section. Download the files that match your game version and language, and follow the instructions in the readme file. You will need to replace the original baldur.exe and tob.exe files with the patched ones.
 
For Call of Duty 2, you will need one no-CD patch for the latest version of the game (v1.3). You can find it at GameBurnWorld[^1^], under the Game Fixes section. Download the file that matches your game language, and follow the instructions in the readme file. You will need to replace the original CoD2SP\_s.exe file with the patched one.
 
After applying the no-CD patches or cracks, you should be able to play Baldur's Gate and Call of Duty 2 without CD. However, remember to backup your original files before modifying them, and to disable any online features that may detect or ban you for using modified files. Enjoy!
  
Now that you know how to play Baldur's Gate and Call of Duty 2 without CD, you might want to learn some tips and tricks to improve your gameplay experience. Here are some of them:
 
## Baldur's Gate Tips and Tricks
 
- Save often and in different slots. Baldur's Gate is a challenging game that can kill you unexpectedly. You don't want to lose hours of progress because of a bad roll or a trap.
- Explore every area and talk to every NPC. You never know what secrets, quests, or items you might find. Some NPCs can also join your party or give you useful information.
- Use the pause button frequently. Baldur's Gate is a real-time game with pause, which means you can pause the game at any time to issue commands to your party members. This is essential for planning your strategy and reacting to changing situations.
- Take advantage of the environment. You can use objects like barrels, crates, or furniture to block enemies, create cover, or set traps. You can also use spells or items to manipulate the environment, such as creating fire, ice, or darkness.
- Customize your party members. You can change their weapons, armor, spells, skills, and scripts to suit your playstyle and preferences. You can also give them unique names and portraits if you want.

## Call of Duty 2 Tips and Tricks

- Aim for the head. Headshots deal more damage and can kill enemies faster than body shots. You can also use the iron sights or scopes to improve your accuracy.
- Use cover and movement. Don't stand still in the open or you will be an easy target for the enemy. Use walls, buildings, vehicles, or terrain features to protect yourself from fire and flank your enemies.
- Reload wisely. Don't wait until your magazine is empty to reload your weapon. Reload when you have a safe moment or when you are behind cover. You can also switch to your secondary weapon or melee attack if you run out of ammo in a close combat situation.
- Use grenades and explosives. Grenades and explosives are great for clearing out groups of enemies, destroying vehicles, or creating diversions. You can also cook grenades by holding them for a few seconds before throwing them, making them harder to avoid.
- Use your squad and allies. You are not alone in this war. Your squad and allies can provide fire support, distract enemies, or follow your orders. You can also use their weapons or ammo if you need them.
